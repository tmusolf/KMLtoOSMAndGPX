# Convert a KML file that was exported from google my maps into a GPX file. 
# This includes OSMAnd extensions and translation of google waypoint icons into a similar OSMAnd icon. 
# Tracks and waypoints are the only objects converted. Folders/layers are used as described in readme.
#
# See readme.md for more details
#
# 4/23/2023: V2.1 Tom Musolf with a little amazing help from ChatGPT
# 4/25/2023: V2.2 If you export a single layer/folder from your google my map it is not
#	put into a folder.  Current code does not check for no folders and only processes
#	tracks and waypoints contained in folders.  So there needs to be special case added
#	to handle the no folder case.  If you have a map with a single layer and export the
#	entire map that single layer will be contained in a folder - so no issues with this case.
#	Also added display counts for waypoint, tracks and folders.
#	Moved waypoint and track processing code into functions so it can be used again
#	in no folder case.
# 4/26/2023: V2.3 Couldn't import KMLtoOSMAndGPX created files into google my maps.  Turns
#	out it was missing "creator" field in the <GPX> element.  Added that and it worked.  Created a
#	couple more functions to eliminate duplicate code blocks.
#9/16/2023: V2.4 Couldn't directly import created files into Garmin basecamp.  If I ran them through
#	GPSVisualizer.com they would work.  Several differences in GPX files so I tweaked some of the GPX
#	data to more closely match GPSVisualizer output.  Down to the <trkseg><extensions> section.  The
#	presence of this section prevents the GPX file from being loaded directly into basecamp.
#	Updated code to put osmand: on <extensions> tags which is what OSMAnd does.

# iconDictionary describes the mapping between a KML icon number and an OSMAnd icon name.
# It also contains a default OSMAnd color and shape to use for each OSMAnd icon type.
# 
# iconDictionary format:
# 	"KML icon number":["OSMAnd Icon name","HTML hex color code or flag to use KMLCOLOR","OSMAnd shape"]
# 
# Color code is a standard 6 digit HTML hex color code.  This is what OSMAnd uses
# 	Put the string "KMLCOLOR", without the double quotes, in for a color value if you want to use the color specified in the KML file
# 	for a particular icon.
# As of 8/2020 OSMAnd icons do not support transparent colors.
# As of 8/2020 OSMAnd supports 3 icon shapes: circle, octagon, square
# 
# To add additional KML icons to the dictionary.
#
# For each icon you want to translate you need to add a new entry/line into the iconDictionary table. 
# To determine what the KML and OSMAnd icons are you want go through the following steps:
#
# KML icon number
# 	1) Create a google my maps test file with the icons you want to use.
# 	2) Export this map as a KML file.  
# 	3) Open up the file in a text editor and look for your points. You can ignore all the <style> & <StyleMap> tags at the 
#	   beginning of the KML file.  The points/waypoints/Placemarks will look like this:
#
#		<Placemark>
#			<name>Mileage Marker dot</name>
#			<styleUrl>#icon-1739-0288D1-nodesc</styleUrl>
#			<Point>
#				<coordinates>-120.8427259,38.8170119,0</coordinates>
#			</Point>
#		</Placemark>

# The <styleUrl> tag has the icon number.  In the preceeding example it's "1739".
#
# OSMAnd Icon name
#	1) Create some favorites using the icons you want.
#	2) Goto .../Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files/favorites/favorites.gpx
#	3) Open the favorites file in a text editor and look for the waypoints.
#	   in the following example the icon name is: "special_trekking"
#
#		<wpt lat="39.2906659" lon="-121.4965106">
#			<name>hiker, pale yellow</name>
#			<extensions>
#			<color>#eeee10</color>
#			<icon>special_trekking</icon>
#			<background>circle</background>
#			</extensions>
#		</wpt>
#
# ???: would be nice to have a command line option to read in a user supplied dictionary from a file
